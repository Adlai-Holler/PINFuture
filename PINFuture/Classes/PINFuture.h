 * A super-simple future implementation.
 * This is a pure objective C implementation that:
 * - is thread-safe
 * - preserves type safety as much as possible
 *
 * Non-goals:
 * - Don't catch Exceptions in callbacks like Promises/A+.  On this platform, Exceptions are generally fatal
 *   and Errors aren't.
 *
 * Future improvement ideas:
 * - Support progress and cancellation.
