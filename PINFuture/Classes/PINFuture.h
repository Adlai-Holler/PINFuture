/**
 * A super-simple future implementation.
 * This is a pure objective C implemtnation that:
 * - is thread-safe
 * - preserves type safety in callbacks as much as possible
 * - Doesn't always defer callbacks to the next runloop tick.
 * - Does not support "thenable" the concept of then-ables or wrapping of values returned from a `then` callback
 *   into a Future.  I haven't been able to find a good value to model this with Objective C's type system, and
 *   the convenience isn't worth the loss of type safety.
 * - does not have any automatic exception catching
 *
 * Future improvement ideas:
 * - Support progress and cancellation.
